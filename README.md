# Pokemon
Basic Pokemon battle simulator for Java console. 

## Description
A wild Pokemon appears! You have the option to either fight, attempt to capture, or run away if you so choose. Each Pokemon starts with a randomly generated health amount. If you choose to attack, there are three different attacks available: Thunderbolt, Quick Attack, and Tackle. Each attack has a different range of damage that it can inflict on the Pokemon depending on how much damage you are looking to do. If you decide you want to take your chances catching the Pokemon, the less HP the wild Pokemon has, the easier it is to catch so weakening the Pokemon will help you out. On the other hand, every turn the Pokemon will also attack you so try your best to catch the Pokemon before you run out of health!
