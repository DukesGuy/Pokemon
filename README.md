# Pokémon
Pokémon battle simulator using Java Swing. 

## Description
A wild Pokémon appears! You have the option to either fight, throw a pokéball, or if you're not up for the challenge... run away. Each Pokémon starts with a randomly generated health amount (25-50). If you choose to attack, there are three different attacks available: Thunderbolt, Quick Attack, and Tackle. Each attack has a separate damage range that will be randomly chosen within that range each turn. If you decide you want to take your chances catching the Pokémon, the odds of catching it increase the less health it has. But be careful... the Pokémon will also attack you after every turn. So try your best to catch the Pokémon without letting it faint before you run out of health!

**UPDATE** : Implemented Java Swing functionality to display game as graphical user interface. Included a title screen and play again option. Added separate class files for code maintainability.
